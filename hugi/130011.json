Nýjasta stoltið mitt er eftirfarandi:\nMary was a sweet girl´s name,\nshe loved to smell the flowers,\nbut one day when she was out\nshe met a man named Dowers.\nHe really didn´t love her much,\njust wanted her to touch him\nwhen the lay in bed at night\ndiscussing nought and nothing.\nDowers left her when she had\njust turned twenty two.\nShe thougth she had found her true love\nbut found herself mistaken.\nDowers was a complete ass\nwith no regards to feelings.\nShe took her life the morning after.\nHanging in a tree, palce face,\nthat was how they found her.\nSeinustu tvö erindin eru svona “afterthought” eins og maður segir á góðri íslensku.",
