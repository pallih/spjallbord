    "text": "Instructions for Life  in the new millennium from the Dalai Lama:\nTake into account that great  love and great achievements involve great risk.\nWhen you  lose, don't lose the lesson.\nFollow the three  R's: Respect for self, respect for others, responsibility for all your  actions.\nRemember that not getting what you  want is sometimes a wonderful  stroke of luck.\nLearn the rules so you know  how to break them properly.\nDon't let a little dispute injure a  great friendship.\nWhen you realize you've made a mistake, take  immediate steps to correct  it.\nSpend some time alone every day.\nOpen your arms to change, but don't let go of  your values.\nRemember that silence is sometimes the best answer.\nLive a good, honorable life. Then when you get older and think back, you'll be able to enjoy it a second time.\nA loving atmosphere in your home is the foundation",
