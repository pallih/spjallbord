    "text": "I see you and I look at the sky,\nall the small things that I have.\nThe feeling that I get from your eyes,\nis that something's out of place.\nMy fear grows deeper each time,\nbut my heart will find a way.\nI know you'll figure it out.\nI know you'll figure it out someway, it out someway.\nI know you'll figure it out someday, it out someday.\nI know you'll figure it out.\nThink of you as night in the sky\nwatching out all the time.\nThe fear grows deeper each time.\nI miss you but things can't stay,\nfeels greatly out of place.\nThat's why I wont follow you back.\nI know you'll figure it out someway, it out someway\nI know you'll figure it out someday, it out someday\nI know you'll figure it out.\nI know you'll figure it out someway, it out someway\nI know you'll figure it out someday, it out someday\nI know you'll figure it out.\n<< Ourlives - Out of place lyrics >>\nSkrifað af mér :)",
