    "text": "There was a couple that lived on sex, sex and sex alone.\nEvery morning the bloke would wake up, roll over and say to his wife “So honey what is for breakfast.”\nShe would reply well I am gorgeous why not have me, so they would have sex for breakfast.\nEvery lunch time, the husband would come back home for lunch. His wife would rip off his clothes and shag him senseless until it was time for him to return to work.\nEvery evening he would come in calling out, “Hi honey I'm home.”\nHis wife would drag him into the kitchen and make mad passionate love on the kitchen floor.\nOne evening he was late home from work. As he walked in, he called, “Hi honey. I'm home.” There was no answer.\nHe walked into the living room and towards the hall. He found his wife completely stark naked sliding up and down the stair banister.\n“What are you doing?” he asked his wife.\nShe replied “Oh just keeping your dinner warm, love!”\n(tekið af www.neonfire.com/spirit_of_joy/jokepages/k/joke_217.shtml)",
