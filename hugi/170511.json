    "text": "A guy sits down in a Cafe' and asks for the hot chili.\nThe waitress says, ‘The guy next to you got the last bowl.’\nHe looks over and sees that the guy's finished his meal,\nbut the chili bowl is still full.\nHe says, ‘Are you going to eat that?’\nThe other guy says, “No. Help yourself.”\nHe takes it and starts to eat it. When he gets about half way down,\nhis fork hits something. He looks down sees a dead mouse in it, and he pukes the chili back into the bowl!\nThe other guy says, “That's about as far as I got, too.”",
