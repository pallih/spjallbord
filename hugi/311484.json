    "text": "You are me winter trees, my sleeping darkness in my awaking dreams,\nmy old childhood fears, the monster in my closet as I softly count to ten.\nYou are the snow that melts down my broken back when the sun won't shine, my before seen chill, the longing I carry as you swiftly disappear.\nI thought I cought a little glimpse, I thought I saw you here,\nthe snow started falling of my winter trees,\nI thought I cought the words, I thought I saw you there,\nmy trees took blossom, embracing their leaves.\nYou are my summer trees, my shining brightness in the rising day,\nmy new exciting fears, the fairy on my shoulder as I softly wish again.\nYou are the leaves that fall down my smiling face when the sun won't leave, my symmer warmth, the longing I carry as you swiftly appear.\nThe snow started falling of my winter trees,\nmy trees took blossom, embracing their leaves.",
