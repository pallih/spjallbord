    "text": "A motorist driving by a Texas ranch hit and killed a\ncalf that was crossing the road.\nThe driver went to the owner of the calf and explained\nwhat had happened. He then asked what the animal was\nworth.\n“Oh, about $200 today,” said the rancher. “But in six\nyears it would have been worth $900. So $900\nis what I'm out.”\nThe motorist sat down and wrote out a check and handed\nit to the farmer.\n“Here,” he said, “is the check for $900.  It is\npostdated six years from now.”",
