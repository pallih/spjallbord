    "text": "At last you've been invited to paradise,\nat last you are where you belong.\nI cried at your funeral, ‘cause I missed you,\ngrandma, I wish that I could have told you…\nthat I loved you.\nI wish I knew where you are,\nand I hope that you didn´t go far.\nI hope that you went to a good place, something like heaven,\nand that you went straight as the clock struck eleven.\nMy only hope is that you didn’t have to suffer,\nand that the cancer made your soul tougher.\nYour four sons were ther by your deathbed,\nthey all saide that they cared for you, these men that you bred.\nTHis poem is for you to read behind my shoulder,\nand knowing that makes my heart bolder.\nAt your grave there stood many,\nI loved you granny, and this I wrote for you, my beloved granny.",
