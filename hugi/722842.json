    "text": "Ég er ekki viss um hvort þetta flokkast sem smásaga eða ljóð o.O. Persónulega finnst mér þetta vera ljóð en kannski er þetta of langt til þess. Eru annars einhverjar reglur á því hversu langt ljóð má vera?\nEverything is quite; the town has gone to sleep this winter night.\nThe moon opens his tiered eyes, lazily he looks down.\nNo one notices a strange man walking by except for the moon.\nUnder the cold, February sky a drunk man walks down the street.\nDeath is lurking in the shadows, close behind him.\nDeath and his whiskey bottle are his allays.\nWho is going to be their victim tonight? The moon wonders.\nA beauty filled with innocence lies in here bed, head filled with dreams.\nLittle does she know about the man in the shadows,\nWhich will soon steal her breath, and sentence her to death.\nHe creeps besides her bed, fingers trample with tension,\nJust before he slides them around her throat.\nHer eyes open; look at him with blue guileless.\nHer red, lustful lips perform the words: ,,You!”\nThere is no judgment, no hate or anger, only a pity and affection.\nHe tightens his grip but her eyes won’t close.\nHe crushes her neck, so soft and warm.\nStill these oceans, blue eyes look at him with compassion.\nFinally her eyes close but her mouth performs a smile.\nHis hands starts to shake, he looks away.\nHer eyes look at him once again and then she is gone.\nNow she lies, for ever gone, quite and still like a doll. His angel.\nEyes wide open but all purity, all life has vanished.\nOnce had those eyes been full of happiness.\nHe lies next to her as his darkness is sucked out of his soul.\nHe lays his fingertips on her stunning face,\nAnd weeps, heart full of sadness for his sins.\nCries because of the darkness he could not controle.\nThe murderer’s tears are spilled all over her pillow.\nThere he lies, cries and finally closes her eyes.\nHis fingers feel her cold face that once was warm and smiling.\nHe lays his hand over her heart that once had been his.\nWitches of jealousy and hate had poisoned his mind.\nThey had filled his heart and soul with anger and suspicion.\nWhat did she do? She looked at him with sympathy.\n-His dry lips whisper through the tears: ,,I am truly sorry.”\nBut nobody hears except for the moon\nsince his angel is forever gone.\nJóhanna Margrét Sigurðardótti",
