    "text": "A soon to be a mother.\nGhost shrouded windows.\nJust what the poet had defined.\nAnd the void begot another.\nBlood tainted river.\nThis birth was mine.\nA new heart started beating.\nThe echo of someone breathing.\nA sound in the rift in time.\nAs I tread this path before me.\nThe stars are engulfed by darkness\nby the sins that shape the void.\nThe sea became my cover\nwhere ripples fade to nothing,\nwhere dying is a crime.\nAnd silence plays a sad song\nthat’s buried in my forehead\nand my eyes are rendered black.\nA horizon without colours.\nA drifting destination.\nA martyr of the end.",
