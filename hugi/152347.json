The series which follows the adventures of four third-graders in the Rocky Mountain fictional town of South Park (the actual South Park is a county) has been referred to as “Peanuts on acid,” and recently landed on critics 10 best lists for 1997 television, including The New York Times and Newsday.\nParker is more than in touch with his inner child, and has been for years. Born and raised in Conifer, Colorado, Parker quickly took an interest in music and has become an accomplished pianist, which he learned to play by imitating Elton John. Parker attended the University of Colorado in Boulder where he first met Matt Stone, co-creator and executive producer of “South Park.” While their Film Studies classmates took the route of “film noir” and other black and white crap, Parker and Stone made crudely produced comedic shorts, including the Student Academy Award-winner “American History” and the original “Frosty Vs. Santa Claus,” the precursor to the now famous “Spirit of Christmas.”\nIn 1994, Parker wrote and directed his first feature-length, live-action film “Cannibal the Musical,” an Oklahoma-esque film based on the life of infamous Colorado cannibal Alfred Packer. The self-produced film, (now available through Troma Video) featuring many of his Colorado friends including Stone, caught the attention of then FoxLab executive Brian Graden. He then commissioned the team to create a Christmas Video card, which he could send to his friends. In Los Angeles without a dime, Parker and Stone took the assignment so they could buy Christmas presents for their families and friends and without even putting their names on it, “The Spirit of Christmas” was born. The five-minute short that featured Jesus and Santa battling it out for ownership of the holiday while the uncensored “South Park” gang looks on, became the must see, guilty pleasure of Hollywood.\nAfter a good, old-fashioned Hollywood bidding war, “South Park” the series made its debut on Comedy Central on August 13, 1997. The series has already garnered a CabIeACE for Best Animated Series, and has also been nominated for the prestigious Environmental Media Award. The original “The Spirit Of Christmas” was just honored with the LA Film Critics' Award for Best Animation. “South Park” is the highest rated original series in Comedy Central history.\nParker is the lead singer of a band (DVDA) whose original songs include “I am Chewbacca” and “Fuck that Guy From Bush.” His second live-action feature “Orgazmo,” about a wholesome Mormon who travels to LA only to wind up a celebrity in the adult film world, will be screened at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival and will be distributed by October Films in spring of 1998.\nRecently Parker appeared in David Zucker's feature-film BASEketball for Universal, co-starring with Matt Stone.\nParker lives at the beach in Los Angeles and uses what little free time he has to play any video game he can. Not the fighting ones though, “they're lame.”\nMatt Stone\nMatt Stone's keen fashion sense isn't the only quality that have catapulted the 27 year-old onto Hollywood's radar… he's also responsible for creating and executive producing, along with Trey Parker, COMEDY CENTRAL's CabIeACE award-winning animated series “South Park.” The half-hour show follows the adventures of four third-graders in the Rocky Mountain fictional town of South Park (The actual South Park is a county) and has been referred to by critics as “Peanuts on acid.”\nStone was born in Houston, Texas and moved when he was very young to Littleton, Colorado, a suburb of Denver. Stone admits to being a bit geeky in school, but managed to get into a lot of trouble even while taking trigonometry at the local high school when he was only in sixth grade.\nStone attended the University of Colorado in Boulder where he first met Parker. Stone realized he and Parker could work together after first visiting Parker's college apartment, where instead of the rice and beans route, Parker served up a slab of roast beef. So, while their Film Studies classmates took the route of “film noir,” Parker and Stone made crudely produced comedic shorts, including the original “Frosty vs. Santa Claus,” the precursor to the now famous “Spirit of Christmas.”\nIn 1994, Stone acted in Parker's first feature-length, live-action film “Cannibal the Musical,” an Oklahoma-esque film on the life of infamous Colorado cannibal Alfred Packer. The self-produced film, (now available through Troma Video) caught the attention of then Fox Lab executive Brian Graden.

The series has already garnered a CabIeACE for Best Animated Series, and has also been nominated for the prestigious Environmental Media Award. “South Park” is COMEDY CENTRAL'S highest rated original series in network history, with the February 4 episode titled “Damien” attracting over 5 million viewers.\nStone is the drummer in a band with Parker called (DVDA) whose original songs include “I am Chewbacca” and “Fuck that Guy from Bush,” are currently seeking a record deal. Stone also produced and acts in Parker's second live-action feature “Orgazmo,” in which he plays the “Dave the lighting guy.” “Orgazmo” screened at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival and will be distributed by October Films in spring of 1998.\nRecently Stone appeared in David Zucker's feature-film BASEketball for Universal, costarring with.. well you get the picture.\nStone lives at the beach in Los Angeles and uses what little free time he has playing basketball so one day he can play in the NBA.",
