    "text": "A new soldier, Santa, was on sentry duty at the main gate. His orders were clear: No car was to enter unless it had a special sticker on the windshield.\nA big Army car came up with a general seated in the back.\nSanta said, “Halt, who goes there?”\nThe sergeant, who was driving, motioned to the back seat and said, “Brigadier.”\n“I`m sorry, I can`t let you through. You have to have a sticker on the windshield.”\nThe Brigadier yelled from the back, “Drive on!”\nSanta replied, “Hold it! You really can`t come through. I have orders to shoot if you try driving in without a sticker.”\nThe Brigadier repeated, “I`m telling you, son, drive on!”\nSanta walked up to the rear window and said, “Sir, I`m new at this. Do I shoot you or your driver?”",
