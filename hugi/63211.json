    "text": "Bob and Bill are driving down the road going about 85 mph. Up comes a red light and Bob goes right through it.\nBill turnes to Bob and says, ‘'What the hell are you doing?’'\nBob says, ‘'Don’t worry—my brother does it all the time.'' So on they go, and — bam! — 85 mph through another red light!\nAgain Bob says, ‘'Don’t worry, my brother does it all the time!'' Then they're driving along and coming up on another red light, and as soon as it turns green, Bob jams on the breaks and skids to a stop!\nBill looks over and says, ‘'What the hell is wrong with you, you jerk? The damn light is green. Why did you stop?’'\nBob says, ‘'My brother may have been coming the other way!’'",
