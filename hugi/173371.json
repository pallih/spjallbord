I will make it a country of dark beautiful mountains, glens and rich green forests. I will give it clear swift-flowing rivers and I will fill them with salmon.”\n“The land shall be lush and fertile, on which the people have barley to brew into an amber nectar that will be much sought after, the world over.”\n“Underneath the land I shall lay rich seams of coal.”\n“In the waters around the shores there will be an abundance of fish and beneath the sea bed there will be vast deposits of oil and gas.”\n“Excuse me, Sir”, interrupted the Archangel Gabriel, “don't you think you are being a bit too generous to these Scots?”\n“Not really” replied the Lord, “wait until you see the neighbours I'm giving them”",
