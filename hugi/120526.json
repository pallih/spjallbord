    "text": "Little Johnny's dad was a retired gambler. Having picked up a\nfew of his old man's bad habits, Johnny wagered on anything and\neverything, and he was good at it. Eventually, it became such a\nproblem, that Johnny's teacher called his father to discuss it.\nAfter a long conversation, they decided to teach him a lesson.\nOne day after class Johnny approached his teacher. “You're not\nreally blonde,” he said. “I've seen your bush and it's pitch\nblack, you dye your hair.” “I most certainly do not,” she\nreplied. “I bet you ten bucks you do,” he said. She saw that\nthis was an opportunity to teach him a lesson, so she waited for\nall the other children to leave the class and took off her\npants, showing him that her pubic hair was the same color as the\nhair on her head. Johnny paid her the ten dollars and walked\nsullenly out of the room.\nA few hours later Johnny's teacher called his father. “I think I\nfinally taught him a lesson,” she said. “The hell you have,” his\nfather said angrily. “This morning he bet me $50 he'd see your\ncunt before the end of the day.”",
