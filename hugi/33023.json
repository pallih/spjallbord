    "text": "THE SLAYER'S LOVE\nIt started at the Hellmouth,\nwhen the Slayer came to town,\na place chock full of Vampires,\nwith no sign of slowing down.\nShe met a man who lived there,\nand Angel was his name,\nshe didn't know, that after him,\nnothing would be the same.\nA brooding lonely figure,\na truly mysterious man,\nwho came warning of disaster,\nthroughout some nefarious plan.\nAngel was how he was known…\na name soon paired with danger…\nThe Slayer knew him mostly as…\nan interfering stranger…\nThe truth soon was discovered,\nafter a frightening night.\nAngel was at the Slayer's house,\nrecovering from a fight.\nA kiss so full of passion,\nfrom the Slayer to her man,\nrevealed, after a fashion,\nwhy from love he'd always ran.\nThe one she'd been so sure about,\nwho'd lit her inner fire,\nturned out to be an enemy,\na full blooded vampire.\nWith crossbow placed between them,\nhe told his tale of woe.\nHow he had become a vampire,\ntwo centuries ago…\nAt first he was quite normal,\nfor a vampire, cruel as sin,\nUntil he killed a young girl,\nand was then cursed by her kin.\nWhen he became a vampire,\nthe demon took his soul,\nto make him true, a creature dire,\nto see he was not whole.\nTo attain true vengeance,\nthe girl's tribe did decide,\nthe way to make him suffer,\nwas to hurt him from inside.\nHis soul they then returned to him.\nHe remembered what he'd done.\nHe knew about the girl he'd killed,\nShe was not the only one.\nHe hurt for all those he had harmed,\nhe now felt true remorse.\nIt was as the tribe had meant.\nPerfect revenge, of course.\nNow he lived with the memories,\nof all his evil days,\ntrying to atone for these,\nin oh-so-many ways.\nThe Slayer she believed him,\nhis sad tale of the past,\nthe curse that still bereaved him,\nmaking that young girl his last.\nBut could she ever love him?\nThat was put to the test.\nFor the love between a Slayer,\nand a vampire's hard at best.\nThey danced around each other,\nbut their love took root and grew.\nAnd then when the Slayer died,\na vampire felt his heart die too.\nThe Slayer killed the Master,\nstayed the summer with her dad,\nBut after her arrival home,\nshe acted rather mad.\nShe'd put up her defenses,\nshe would let no one near,\ntrying to hide, her hurting heart,\nand hiding well her fear.\nBut it was still so hard to hide,\nfrom her nearest dearest friends.\nThe terror and the pain she felt,\nwhen facing her loose ends.\nThe Slayer saw that no one,\ncould again raise the Master,\nSmashing all his bones to powder,\ncrying in her love's arms after.\nThey began to get to know,\neach other somewhat better,\ntesting the waters a little more,\ntheir feet getting much wetter.\nStealing hidden kisses after dark,\nstealing kisses on hunts in the park.\nWith a love that only death could break,\nand a love that only love could take.\nOn the Slayer's birthday,\na time for laughs and fun,\nanother evil thing to slay,\nthe Slayer was undone.\nAngel and the Slayer,\nwere forced to cut and run,\nfleeing quickly through the rain,\nthey reached the home of one.\nA dangerous night,\nwhere passions ran high,\nmade the Slayer's tears fall,\nand the Slayer's heart die.\nThe pain that she felt,\nwas hard to control,\nwhen she saw her love's face,\nso bereft of his soul.\nHis words were like fire,\nsuch a cruel heart.\nA sulphur-tongued liar,\nevil's just a start,\nwith a creature so dire.\nBut the Slayer will stand,\nheld by many a hand,\nchoking down her own fright,\nwill face down the night…\nBy Muldair Mary Moore",
