They can go and edit it all they want. Even further, you're claiming that you have the power to grant these rights. So no one who works for Conde Nast (Wired, Arstechnica), TechCrunch, Gawker, any of the other big web publishers, or a university where the employee is performing research can agree to the Chrome ToS because they most likely don't have the right to give a license to the intellectual property (IP) they produce. \"", "date": "2008-09-03 16:28:00", "post_id": 1}, {"user_name": "BjarkiFJ", "text": "finst þetta nu bara alveg eins og IE ..", "date": "2008-09-03 16:59:00", "post_id": 2}, {"user_name": "Ægir?", "text": "http://live2cruize.com/spjall/showthread.php?t=72278", "date": "2008-09-03 17:06:00", "post_id": 3}], "file_urls": [], "date": "2008-09-03 16:28:00", "files": []}
