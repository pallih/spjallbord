Also removes fingerprints and hard-earned guitar callouses from fingers in about the time it takes you to say, 'Yeouw....'\n\r\nELECTRIC HAND DRILL: Normally used for spinning pop rivets in their holes until you die of old age, or for perforating something behind and beyond the original intended target object. \n\r\nSKIL SAW: A portable cutting tool used to make studs too short.\n\r\nPLIERS: Used to round off bolt heads. Sometimes used in the creation of blood-blisters.\n\r\nBELT SANDER: An electric sanding tool commonly used to convert minor touch-up jobs into major refinishing jobs. Caution: Avoid using for manicures.\n\r\nHACKSAW: One of a family of cutting tools built for frustration enhancement. It transforms human energy into a crooked, unpredictable motion, and the more you attempt to influence its course, the more dismal your future becomes.\n\r\nVISE-GRIPS: Generally used after pliers to completely round off bolt heads. If nothing else is available, they can also be used to transfer intense welding heat to the palm of your hand.\n\r\nWELDING GLOVES: Heavy duty leather gloves used to prolong the conduction of intense welding heat to the palm of your hand.\n\r\nOXYACETYLENE TORCH: Used almost entirely for lighting various flammable objects in your shop on fire. Also handy for igniting the grease inside the wheel hub you want the bearing race out of.\n\r\nWHITWORTH SOCKETS: Once used for working on older British cars and motorcycles, they are now used mainly for impersonating that 9/16 or 1/2 socket you've been searching for the last 45 minutes.\n\r\nTABLE SAW: A large stationary power tool commonly used to launch wood projectiles for testing wall integrity.\n\r\nHYDRAULIC FLOOR JACK: Used for lowering an automobile to the ground after you have installed your new brake shoes, trapping the jack handle firmly under the bumper.\n\r\nEIGHT-FOOT LONG YELLOW PINE 4X4: Used for levering an automobile upward off of a trapped hydraulic jack handle.\n\r\nTWEEZERS: A tool for removing wood splinters and wire wheel wires.\n\r\nE-Z OUT BOLT AND STUD EXTRACTOR: A tool ten times harder than any known drill bit that snaps neatly off in bolt holes thereby ending any possible future use.\n\r\nRADIAL ARM SAW: A large stationary power saw primarily used by most shops to scare neophytes into choosing another line of work.\n\r\nTWO-TON ENGINE HOIST: A tool for testing the maximum tensile strength of everything you forgot to disconnect.\n\r\nCRAFTSMAN 1/2 x 24-INCH SCREWDRIVER: A very large pry bar that inexplicably has an accurately machined screwdriver tip on the end opposite the handle.\n\r\nAVIATION METAL SNIPS: See hacksaw.\n\r\nTROUBLE LIGHT: The home mechanic's own tanning booth. Sometimes called a drop light, it is a good source of vitamin D, 'the sunshine vitamin,' which is not otherwise found under cars at night. Health benefits aside, its main purpose is to consume 40- watt light bulbs at about the same rate that 105mm howitzer shells might be used during, say, the first few hours of the Battle of the Bulge. More often dark than light, its name is somewhat misleading. The accessory socket within the base, has been permanently rendered useless, unless requiring a source of 117vac power to shock the mechanic\r\nsenseless.\n\r\nPHILLIPS SCREWDRIVER: Normally used to stab the vacuum seals under lids, opening old-style paper-and-tin oil cans and splashing oil on your shirt; but can also be used, as the name implies, to strip out Phillips screw heads.\n\r\nSTRAIGHT SCREWDRIVER: A tool for opening paint cans. Sometimes used to convert common slotted screws into non-removable screws.\n\r\nAIR COMPRESSOR: A machine that takes energy produced in a coal-burning power plant 200 miles away and transforms it into compressed air that travels by hose to a Chicago Pneumatic impact gun that grips rusty bolts which were last over tightened 40 years ago by someone at VW, and instantly rounds\r\noff their heads. Also used to quickly snap off lug nuts.\n\r\nPRY BAR: A tool used to crumple the metal surrounding that clip or bracket you needed to remove in order to replace a 50 cent part.\n\r\nHOSE CUTTER: A tool used to make hoses too short.\n\r\nHAMMER: Originally employed as a weapon of war, the hammer nowadays is used as a kind of divining rod to locate the most expensive parts adjacent to the object we are trying to hit.\n\r\nMECHANIC'S KNIFE: Used to open and slice through the contents of cardboard cartons delivered to your front door; works particularly well on contents such as seats, vinyl records, liquids in plastic bottles, collector magazines, refund checks, and rubber or plastic parts. Especially useful for slicing work clothes, but only while in use. It is also useful for removing large chunks of human flesh from the user's hands.\n\r\nDAMMIT TOOL: (I have lot's of these) Any handy tool that you grab and throw across the garage while yelling 'DAMMIT' at the top of your lungs. It is also, most often, the next tool that you will need after a really big hammer\n\r\nTekið af bmwkraft. <<<icon_biggrin.gif>>>", "date": "2008-03-28 08:55:00", "post_id": 1}, {"user_name": "Oskar K", "text": "HOSE CUTTER: A tool used to make hoses too short.\n\nhahahahahahahaha been there\n\ndjöf snilld er þetta <<<icon_lol.gif>>>", "date": "2008-03-28 08:57:00", "post_id": 2}, {"user_name": "spark", "text": "hvað með að koma með íslensk orð eins og tildæmis\n\n\n\r\nHandrið, dráttarvél ooog sjálfssali  <<<rolleyes.png>>> ábyggilega til eitthver fleirri misskilinn orð", "date": "2008-03-28 09:47:00", "post_id": 3}, {"user_name": "BIGBRO", "text": "vó hvað ég nenni ekki að lesa þetta:P", "date": "2008-03-28 09:50:00", "post_id": 4}, {"user_name": "BiggiÞ", "text": "haha þetta er brilljant <<<icon_biggrin.gif>>>", "date": "2008-03-28 17:20:00", "post_id": 5}], "file_urls": ["http://live2cruize.com/spjall/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif", "http://live2cruize.com/spjall/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif", "http://live2cruize.com/spjall/images/smilies/rolleyes.png", "http://live2cruize.com/spjall/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif"], "date": "2008-03-28 08:55:00", "files": [{"url": "http://live2cruize.com/spjall/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif", "path": "full/24620e8136e134c2ee38603a088528683844d88a.gif", "checksum": "f970a6591668c625e4b9dbd3b7a450d7"}, {"url": "http://live2cruize.com/spjall/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif", "path": "full/fa705ed47e899453195f9b57838cc55ca8fdd97f.gif", "checksum": "b76e7729d43c4a49182d020741285bef"}, {"url": "http://live2cruize.com/spjall/images/smilies/rolleyes.png", "path": "full/b1b10fbdbea04f643e001c1bc3f05deef3fd5658.png", "checksum": "fbc495dd6fc67d511c2b63ee16738a0d"}, {"url": "http://live2cruize.com/spjall/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif", "path": "full/24620e8136e134c2ee38603a088528683844d88a.gif", "checksum": "f970a6591668c625e4b9dbd3b7a450d7"}]}
