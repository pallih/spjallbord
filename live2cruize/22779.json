Late in the evening, the officer\r\nnoticed a man leaving the bar so intoxicated that he could barely walk.\r\nThe man stumbled around the parking lot for a few minutes with the officer\r\nquietly watching. After what seemed an eternity and trying his keys on five different\r\nvehicles, the man managed to find his own car which he fell into.\r\nHe was there for a few minutes as a number of other patrons left the bar\r\nand drove off.\n\r\nFinally, he started his car, switched the wipers on and off (it was\r\na dry night), flicked the hazard flasher on and off, tooted the horn\r\nand then switched on the lights. He moved the vehicle forward a few\r\ninches, reversed a little and then remained stationary for a few more\r\nminutes as more patrons left in their vehicles.\n\r\nAt last he pulled out of the parking lot and started to drive slowly\r\ndown the street. The police officer having patiently waited all\r\nthis time, now started up his patrol car, put on the flashing lights,\r\npromptly pulled the man over and carried out a breathalyzer test.\n\r\nTo his amazement the breathalyzer indicated no evidence that the man\r\nconsumed alcohol no at all.\n\r\nDumbfounded, the office said \"I'll have to ask you to accompany me to\r\nthe police station. This breathalyzer equipment must be broken.\"\n\r\n\"I doubt it,\" said the man. \"Tonight I'm the designated decoy.\" \n\n\n\n\r\nHahahahah maður þyrfti að prófa þetta einhvern tímann þegar maður fer út á lífið.  <<<icon_lol.gif>>> <<<drunken_smilie.gif>>> <<<rofl.gif>>>", "date": "2007-01-29 14:58:00", "post_id": 1}, {"user_name": "Sæli", "text": "hahahaahahahahahah!", "date": "2007-01-29 15:39:00", "post_id": 2}, {"user_name": "Viktorkarl", "text": "hahah, en löggan hérna væri ALDREI nægilega þolinmóð til að bíða eftir einum gutta, væri löngu búin að skipta sér að  <<<icon_lol.gif>>>", "date": "2007-01-29 16:33:00", "post_id": 3}, {"user_name": "intenz", "text": "SNILLD!!! <<<rofl.gif>>>", "date": "2007-01-29 16:59:00", "post_id": 4}, {"user_name": "hundur", "text": "þetta er bara snilld <<<rofl.gif>>>", "date": "2007-01-29 17:42:00", "post_id": 5}], "file_urls": ["http://live2cruize.com/spjall/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif", "http://live2cruize.com/spjall/images/smilies/drunken_smilie.gif", "http://live2cruize.com/spjall/images/smilies/rofl.gif", "http://live2cruize.com/spjall/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif", "http://live2cruize.com/spjall/images/smilies/rofl.gif", "http://live2cruize.com/spjall/images/smilies/rofl.gif"], "date": "2007-01-29 14:58:00", "files": [{"url": "http://live2cruize.com/spjall/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif", "path": "full/fa705ed47e899453195f9b57838cc55ca8fdd97f.gif", "checksum": "b76e7729d43c4a49182d020741285bef"}, {"url": "http://live2cruize.com/spjall/images/smilies/drunken_smilie.gif", "path": "full/b601b67e63a495e69bf9241fbe279161d81727c2.gif", "checksum": "0ad55663e86c33e6cfeb81d4eef2fe45"}, {"url": "http://live2cruize.com/spjall/images/smilies/rofl.gif", "path": "full/51b00a571877dec3874bcb115ce2e201729ce345.gif", "checksum": "1ad96412c720bd904dce789340e6228f"}, {"url": "http://live2cruize.com/spjall/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif", "path": "full/fa705ed47e899453195f9b57838cc55ca8fdd97f.gif", "checksum": "b76e7729d43c4a49182d020741285bef"}, {"url": "http://live2cruize.com/spjall/images/smilies/rofl.gif", "path": "full/51b00a571877dec3874bcb115ce2e201729ce345.gif", "checksum": "1ad96412c720bd904dce789340e6228f"}, {"url": "http://live2cruize.com/spjall/images/smilies/rofl.gif", "path": "full/51b00a571877dec3874bcb115ce2e201729ce345.gif", "checksum": "1ad96412c720bd904dce789340e6228f"}]}
