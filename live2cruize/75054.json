Eitthver sammála mér ?\n\r\nSamt finnst mér Observe and Report miklu fyndnari <<<icon_smile.gif>>>\n\n\n\r\nFann hérna 10 ways Observe And Report And Paul Blart Mall Cop Are Like\n\n1. The fat guy living with his fat mom who pities him.\nIt's not just the mall cop careers that make Paul Blart and Ronnie Barnhardt seem so similar. Both obviously struggle with their weight, and both live with their equally overweight moms, who are supportive and maybe a little overbearing and, in Ronnie's case, a huge mess.\n\n2. The silly two-wheeled vehicle used for transportation.\nPaul rides a Segway both in the mall and out, a cheap joke that's used way too many times. Ronnie rides a white Honda motorcycle, which is left as a subtle jab never mentioned by the characters. At the mall Ronnie has an equally-ridiculous ride, a white egg-shaped golf cart, but since it has four wheels, it doesn't count.\n\n3. The archnemesis working outside the mall with more power.\nPaul Blart's rival is a SWAT team agent and former high school classmate played by Bobby Cannavale, brought in at the end to handle the robbery in progress. Ronnie's is a much bigger character played by Ray Liotta, a cop who is just as power-mad and maybe deranged as Ronnie, but just does a better job at keeping his cool.\n\r\n4. The jokes about mall cops not actually having guns.\nProbably the one shared joke between the two movies is one about having to pretend you have a gun even though you're not allowed one. Apparently this is a pretty universal mall cop gripe.\n\n5. The pretty girl crush who works in cosmetics in the mall.\nFor Paul, it's weave salesgirl Amy, played by a very bland but very pretty Jayma Mays. For Ronnie, it's makeup salesgirl Brandi, played by a batshit crazy but also very pretty Anna Faris. \n\n6. The night out drinking that ends badly, sorta.\nPaul Blart doesn't really drink, so when he goes out with the other mall workers and downs a margarita before he knows what it is, the night ends in some embarrassing karaoke and falling through a plate glass window. Brandi, on the other hand, is an experienced drinker and pill-taker, but that doesn't stop her from getting just as hammered as Paul does. And while Paul makes a connection with his dream girl while drinking (but before falling through the window), Ronnie gets some face time with the lady as well (before she falls asleep while they're having sex.)\n\r\n7. The rivalry with one other mall employee.\nPaul is constantly teased by a guy working at the bank named Stuart. Ronnie has an ongoing \"fuck you\" battle with Saddam, who works at the lotion kiosk. \n\n8. The police training montage.\nBoth Paul and Ronnie really want to be real cops, and while Paul's dream ends in the first scene when he flunks out of the obstacle course, Ronnie hits training halfway through the movie, and is actually pretty good at it. It's the psychological profile that'll get you, though.\n\nSPOILER FRAMUNDAN\n\n9. The right-hand man who turns out to be a thief.\nAt the end of Paul Blart it turns out that--gasp!-- the new cop trainee was helping the robbers all along! About three-quarters of the way through Observe and Report, it turns out that the sidekick played by Michael Pena-- gasp!-- is a robber too. \n\r\n10. The final showdown in the beloved mall.\nAt the end both Paul and Ronnie have to protect their own turf against invading hordes, and they're the only men for the job. For Paul, this is because he's literally the only person in the mall who hasn't been taken hostage. For Ronnie, it's because he's a complete psychopath.\n\n\n/SPOILER", "date": "2009-04-20 13:17:00", "post_id": 1}, {"user_name": "JoeyThunder", "text": "já alveg sammála, og Observe and Report er fyndari.", "date": "2009-04-20 13:34:00", "post_id": 2}, {"user_name": "arnisolon", "text": "observe and report er alltof fyndin!", "date": "2009-04-20 13:52:00", "post_id": 3}, {"user_name": "Meso", "text": "Ég á eftir að sjá Observe and report, en Paul Blart var sorp!\r\nHefði verið skárra að góna á hvítan vegg í 90 mín <<<rolleyes.png>>>", "date": "2009-04-20 16:49:00", "post_id": 4}], "file_urls": ["http://live2cruize.com/spjall/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif", "http://live2cruize.com/spjall/images/smilies/rolleyes.png"], "date": "2009-04-20 13:17:00", "files": [{"url": "http://live2cruize.com/spjall/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif", "path": "full/1b4c582c326e1f58ed353744337401937e95b553.gif", "checksum": "9ee646ffab71107d1a11407be52f33a5"}, {"url": "http://live2cruize.com/spjall/images/smilies/rolleyes.png", "path": "full/b1b10fbdbea04f643e001c1bc3f05deef3fd5658.png", "checksum": "fbc495dd6fc67d511c2b63ee16738a0d"}]}
