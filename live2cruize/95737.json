Maybe interested in a swap for something more practical either EK9 or Integra. Anyway here goes...\n\r\nHonda Civic SIR2 1993 67k\n\r\nReg: K580GFS \n\r\nThe car was purchased through Private Imports in Oct 2008. It cost the previous owner around £6300 including extras. Receipts to prove \n\r\nTo start with: \n\r\nMot till Oct 2009 (New MOT not a problem)\r\nTax till Sept 2009 \n\r\nMods out side the car: \n\r\nB18c engine Integra Type R JDM model including lsd \r\nBuddy Club coilovers \r\nBoot latches \r\nColour coded splitter and skirts \r\nZigen Border 304 Exhaust \r\nDC-Sports 4-1 header \r\nDe-cat pipe \r\nRota Slip Stream 15\" (lots of tread) \r\nJ's Induction kit \r\nHKS F-con IS Management \r\nBraided fuel lines \r\nNew rear Discs and pads\r\nFront hard compound pads.\r\nUprated bushes.\r\nSpoon radiator cap\r\nNot sure if the brakes are standard as they feel a whole lot better than normal sir brakes.\r\nI think the car may have had a respray at some point in its life as the main paintwork is almost immaculate after a clean and polish..\n\n\n\r\nMods inside the car: \n\r\nFull roll-cage \r\nRear Strut Brace \r\nBride Bucket seat with Sir for Passenger \r\nSparco Snap-off Steering wheel \r\nDefi Gauge Controller \r\nDefi Oil pressure gauge \r\nDefi Temperature gauge\r\nCD player (Requires speakers, all removed) \n\n\r\nWhen it was imported, Private Imports changed the cam belt and gave it a service so it was in tip top condition.\n\r\nThe previous owner had an HKS F-con IS management fitted as well as a de cat and DC sports 4-1 header. When it was tweaked with it reached 214bhp and 147lb-ft. A dyno sheet can prove this along with the bill for all the work (all in came to £1200) HKS F-Con does support many programmes suitable for Honda. HKS USA Permission Denied \n\r\nOther garage work since original purchase include: \r\nFull coolant system flush and new thermostat \r\nIridium power performance spark plugs \r\nNew oem fuel tank \n\r\nI recently had it serviced including changing the gearbox oil and giving the car a good check over. No faults found!\n\r\nFrom the original purchase price in October 08 and the money spent on it since then it totals up to over £8000. It has always been warmed up before going anywhere near vtec, by myself and previous owner. Just generally well looked after and cleaned regularly\n\r\nThe car comes with a Thatcham 1 Sigma Alarm. Including manual, 2 fobs and certificate.  Car also comes with 3 keys. \n\r\nI am the second UK owner.\n\r\nAs always there are a few minor bad bits: \n\r\nThere is a little crack on the front bumper below the headlight \r\nFront splitter could do with a re-spray. I've touched it up slightly\r\nAir-con pulley is not attached \r\nA couple tiny dinks on rear quarter\n\n\r\nForgot to mention it has been HPI cleared with documentation. This car is very quick. Previous owner ran a quarter mile in 14.1. This was before the F-con, De cat, manifold and tune up\n\r\nContact me on 07969 158 228 \r\nLocation: Edinburgh \n\r\nPrice is £5600 ovno.\n\r\nAny questions or for more photos please ask!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nThese are the old import photos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n^^^ Old wheels\n\n\r\nMore recent ones", "date": "2009-10-03 21:03:00", "post_id": 1}, {"user_name": "Erica", "text": "já halló! virkilega smekklegur <<<icon_cool.gif>>>", "date": "2009-10-03 22:11:00", "post_id": 2}, {"user_name": "h1coupe", "text": "ekkert að þessu<<<icon_cool.gif>>>", "date": "2009-10-03 22:15:00", "post_id": 3}, {"user_name": "krayzie", "text": "oj sér enginn húddskópið og hvíta lippið ? <<<icon_lol.gif>>>", "date": "2009-10-03 23:50:00", "post_id": 4}, {"user_name": "h1coupe", "text": "mér finnst ekkert að lippinu en er ekki alveg að skilja þetta scoupe?", "date": "2009-10-04 00:10:00", "post_id": 5}, {"user_name": "GudniR33", "text": "edit<<<icon_smile.gif>>>", "date": "2009-10-04 00:40:00", "post_id": 6}, {"user_name": "APEXi", "text": "ágætur... skil ekki pointið með þessum gormum og shittinu á skottinu.. sýnist vera komið ryð undan því", "date": "2009-10-04 18:11:00", "post_id": 7}], "file_urls": ["http://live2cruize.com/spjall/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif", "http://live2cruize.com/spjall/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif", "http://live2cruize.com/spjall/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif", "http://live2cruize.com/spjall/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif"], "date": "2009-10-03 21:03:00", "files": [{"url": "http://live2cruize.com/spjall/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif", "path": "full/268b6de7ac68d94c2755e424eca1572f6620d521.gif", "checksum": "25c83ea511f206e88f214719dad9c88c"}, {"url": "http://live2cruize.com/spjall/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif", "path": "full/268b6de7ac68d94c2755e424eca1572f6620d521.gif", "checksum": "25c83ea511f206e88f214719dad9c88c"}, {"url": "http://live2cruize.com/spjall/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif", "path": "full/fa705ed47e899453195f9b57838cc55ca8fdd97f.gif", "checksum": "b76e7729d43c4a49182d020741285bef"}, {"url": "http://live2cruize.com/spjall/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif", "path": "full/1b4c582c326e1f58ed353744337401937e95b553.gif", "checksum": "9ee646ffab71107d1a11407be52f33a5"}]}
