However, Gemballa's latest proposal is set to become to the most outrageous supercar on Supercars.net.\n\r\nGemballa USA is seriously representing that they are going to modify a Carrera GT in much the same way they push out the current 911 to make over 750 bhp. That is, attach twin turbochargers and make a 1000 bhp monster.\n\r\nHowever, Gemballa's ambitions don't end there. This hypothetical makeover also includes a gullwing doors and a new carbon fiber roof, tested in the wind tunnel for 250 mph crusing.\n\r\nDo we believe this? Not yet. But if these photoshop images make the press rounds, maybe a CGT owner that doesn't believe in warranties will supply a donor car. Unfortunately, Gemballa told the Dupont Registry it would take 1.5 million euros to complete the upgrade. Our fingers are still crossed.\n\r\n(allt tekið frá supercars.net)", "date": "2005-05-12 11:42:00", "post_id": 1}, {"user_name": "AnyKey", "text": "Já fá eitt stykki svona bíl og bland í poka fyrir afganginn.", "date": "2005-05-12 12:20:00", "post_id": 2}, {"user_name": "APEXi", "text": "Nettur", "date": "2005-05-12 13:32:00", "post_id": 3}, {"user_name": "Bigginn", "text": "Já eða ekki", "date": "2005-05-31 17:33:00", "post_id": 4}, {"user_name": "hundur", "text": "Þetta er bara geggjuð Carrera GT.", "date": "2005-05-31 17:48:00", "post_id": 5}], "file_urls": [], "date": "2005-05-12 11:42:00", "files": []}
