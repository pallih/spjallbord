There were no survivors.\n\r\n2) If you rearrange the letters in Vin Diesel it reveals his credo: \"I End Lives.\"\n\r\n3) There is no theory of evolution, just a list of creatures Vin Diesel allows to live.\n\r\n4) When Vin Diesel goes to donate blood, he declines the syringe, and instead requests a hand gun and a bucket.\n\r\n5) Even Vin Diesel doesn't know why no fact has a rating of 9 or above.\n\r\n6) There is no \"I\" in team.

He found himself stumped on the last page of Where's Waldo Now?, not being able to find the Waldo without a shoe. He threw the book down and screamed, \"This is BULLSHIT!\" They're all wearing shoes.\" He then proceeded to eat the book and exclaim, \"IF I CAN'T FIND WALDO, THEN NO ONE CAN!\" The book he ate belonged to a child that he had borrowed it from. The child began to cry and Vin ate him for good measure. The incident has since been refered to as Christmas.\n\r\n10) Vin Diesel is the reason why Waldo is hiding.\n\r\n11) Vin Diesel once beat Super Mario Bros 3 without even touching his Nintendo controller.

That's Vin Diesel!\" Then she had had sex with him. At that point, she was the third girl he had slept with.\n\r\n17) If you were to lock Vin Diesel in a room with a guitar, a year later you would have the greatest album ever, it would sweep the Grammy's. When asked why he doesn't do this Vin replied \"Because Grammy's are for queers.\" then he ate a knife to show the seriousness of his response.\n\r\n18) Vin Diesel played Russian Roulete with a fully loaded gun and won.\n\r\n19) Vin Diesel was the hunter who shot Bambi's Mother. He then wore her carcass like it was a coat while he made his rounds at the local children's hospital.\n\r\n20) Vin Diesel coined the phrase, \"I could eat a Horse\" after he ate every last unicorn in existence.\n\r\n21) It takes 14 puppeteers to make Vin Diesel smile, but only 2 to make him destroy an orphanage.\n\r\n22) Vin Diesel is not lactose intolerant, he just refuses to put up with lactose's shit.\n\r\n23) On his birthday, Vin Diesel randomly selects one lucky child to be thrown into the sun.\n\r\n24) When Vin Diesel does a pushup, he isn't lifting himself up, he's pushing the Earth down.\n\r\n25) In fine print at on the last page of the Guiness Book of World Records it notes that all world records are held by Vin Diesel, and those listed in the book are simply the closest anyone has ever come to matching him.\n\r\n26) Vin Diesel can divide by zero.\n\r\n27) Vin Diesel's hair is too afraid of him to grow.\n\r\n28) Magnetic compasses do not point toward true North - they point in the direction of Vin Diesel.
