This particular car was fitted with a full Porsche roll bar and racing harnesses.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately these safety features do not seem to have made a difference. Reports suggest that the driver had only purchased the car 4 hours previously. The crash occurred at a speed of around 160mph and \"he was airborne when he hit\" a truck.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSadly, from the severity of the impact it is unlikely that any occupants survived however at the current time it is unknown.\nIt is hard to believe that that used to be the fastest 911 ever produced.\n\nThe original source of this crash and the pictures is Shreknow91 from luxury4play who received an email including the pictures and this quote;\n \"This is the fastest Porsche 911 ever produced. 2011 GT2 RS. I tried to buy this car about 2 months ago. They retailed it a few weeks later. This happened about 4 hours after the guy picked it up. Estimated speed when he hit the semi-truck was 160mph. Report also said he was airborne when he hit. It had a full Porsche roll bar with harnesses.\"\n\nThis goes to show that you should always remain sensible while on public roads, especially in a car you haven't owned for long.", "date": "2012-10-12 15:45:00", "post_id": 1}, {"user_name": "Loud1", "text": "magnað..", "date": "2012-10-13 13:20:00", "post_id": 2}, {"user_name": "Rafnars", "text": "<<<icon_surprised.gif>>><<<crybaby2.gif>>>", "date": "2012-10-13 15:16:00", "post_id": 3}, {"user_name": "syggy", "text": "þetta gerðist nú svipað hérna heima 2008 það var reyndar gt3rs bíll http://www.visir.is/faer-engar-baetu.../2009983864982", "date": "2012-10-13 15:22:00", "post_id": 4}, {"user_name": "addistra", "text": "shiii", "date": "2012-10-13 15:38:00", "post_id": 5}, {"user_name": "bongothemongo1", "text": "Djjöfull er hann fáránlega illa farinn!... eða kanski ekki miðað við ferðina sem hann var á :S", "date": "2012-10-13 15:47:00", "post_id": 6}], "file_urls": ["http://live2cruize.com/spjall/images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif", "http://live2cruize.com/spjall/images/smilies/crybaby2.gif"], "date": "2012-10-12 15:45:00", "files": [{"url": "http://live2cruize.com/spjall/images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif", "path": "full/d290c0b1b0a24c0e501c16bf56f989b5c89a036d.gif", "checksum": "ae735b5dd659dc4b3b0f249ce59bef79"}, {"url": "http://live2cruize.com/spjall/images/smilies/crybaby2.gif", "path": "full/654444ed28496f6bcf5c27eb205ea3c6937831d9.gif", "checksum": "e8bc88c8c3dbf5b641e8240fc71c4bc8"}]}
