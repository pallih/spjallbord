Before the policeman has a chance to ask\r\nany questions, the Indian starts screaming hysterically:\n\r\n\"My Porsche, my beautiful black Porsche is ruined. No matter how long it takes\r\nat the panel beaters, it'll simply never be the same again!\"\n\r\nAfter the Indian finally finishes his rant, the policeman shakes his head in disgust:\r\n\"I can't believe how materialistic you bloody Indians are. You lot are so focused\r\non your possessions that you don't notice anything else in your life.\"\n\r\n\"How can you say such a thing at a time like this?\", snaps the Indian.\n\r\nThe policeman replies,\r\n\"Didn't you realise that your right arm was torn off when the truck hit you.\"\n\r\nThe Indian looks down in absolute horror \"F***ING HELL!\" he screams....................\n\r\n\"Where's my Rolex ????\"\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTHE GEOGRAPHY OF WOMAN\n\r\nBetween 18 and 20, a woman is like Africa. Half discovered, half-wild, naturally beautiful with fertile deltas.\n\r\nBetween 21 and 30, a woman is like America. Well developed and open to trade, especially for someone with cash.\n\r\nBetween 31 and 35, she is like India. Very hot, relaxed and convinced of her own beauty.\n\r\nBetween 36 and 40, a woman is like France. Gently aging but still a warm and desirable place to visit.\n\r\nBetween 41 and 50, she is like Yugoslavia. Lost the war, haunted by past mistakes. Massive reconstruction is now necessary.\n\r\nBetween 51 and 60, she is like Russia, Very wide and borders are un-patrolled. The frigid climate keeps people away.\n\r\nBetween 61 and 70, a woman is like Mongolia. A glorious and all conquering past but alas, no future.\n\r\nAfter 70, they become like Afghanistan. Everyone knows where it is, but no one wants to go there.\n\nTHE GEOGRAPHY OF A MAN\n\r\nBetween 15 and 90, a man is like Zimbabwe. Ruled by a d_ck.\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\r\nTwo men dressed in pilots' uniforms walk up the aisle of the airplane.\r\nBoth are wearing dark glasses; one is using a guide dog and the other is tapping his way along the aisle with a cane. Nervous laughter spreads through the cabin, but the men enter the cockpit, the door closes, and the engines startup.\n\r\nThe passengers begin glancing around nervously, searching for some sign that this is just a little practical joke.\r\nNo sign is forthcoming. The plane moves faster and faster down the runway and the people sitting in the window seats realize that they are headed straight for the water at the edge of the airport.\n\r\nJust as it begins to look as though the plane will plough into the water, panicked screams fill the cabin. At that moment, the plane lifts smoothly into the air. The passengers relax and laugh a little sheepishly, and soon all retreat into their magazines, secure in the knowledge that the plane is in good hands.\n\r\nIn the cockpit, one of the blind pilots turns to the other and says, \"You know, Bob, one of these days they're going to scream too late and we're all going to die.\"\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\r\nTwas the night before Christmas and caught at the light,\r\nWas a domestic V8 and no cops in sight,\r\nI will try, I will try, I will try with this small motor,\r\nTo beat this damn Camaro, even with its big blower,\r\nAs the light goes green and I pull like no joke,\r\nThe Camaro erupts in clouds of tire smoke,\r\nNow Smasher, now Rev-ver, now Stroker, now Blitzin,\r\nThese are the names of my four VTEC pistons,\r\nRacing ahead I’m the star of the action,\r\nBut I know I’m in trouble when V8 gets traction,\r\nGrabbing second, I hear the RPM’s sing,\r\nMy mirror is blocked by my shopping kart wing,\r\nI now hear the roar of the big monster gaining,\r\nAll I can do is keeping the four-banger straining,\r\nIn a second, the shock wave hits with a blast,\r\nAnd my stickers go flying now a thing of the past,\r\nDon’t bother with third, cause now it’s too late,\r\nJust try to act cool, like you can relate,\r\nLooking up at the taillights as they get smaller,\r\nThe driver back off just to give me a holler,\r\n\"You can’t win them all,\" he says in fling,\r\n\"You may not win any, in that silly thing,\"\r\nI smiled and revved as he pulled out of sight,\r\nWith my new mods tomorrow…it will be a better night.\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\r\nA HIGH SCHOOL GIRL FINALLY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO A PARTY ALONE,\n\r\nSINCE SHE WAS GOOD LOOKING, SHE WAS A BIT NERVOUS ABOUT WHAT TO DO\n\r\nIF BOYS HIT ON HER, SO HER MOM SAID, IT'S VERY EASY, WHENEVER A BOY\r\nSTARTS HITTING ON YOU, YOU ASK HIM, \"WHAT WILL BE THE NAME OF OUR BABY?\"\n\r\nTHAT WILL SCARE THEM OFF, SO SHE WENT.\n\r\nAFTER A LITTLE WHILE AT THE PARTY A BOY STARTED DANCING WITH HER, AND\r\nLITTLE BY LITTLE, KISSING HER AND TOUCHING HER. SHE ASKED HIM,\n\r\n\"WHAT WILL OUR BABY BE CALLED?\" THE BOY FOUND SOME EXCUSE AND\r\nDISAPPEARED.\n\r\nSOME TIME LATER THE SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN, A BOY STARTED TO KISS HER\r\nNECK, HER SHOULDERS........ SHE STOPPED HIM AND ASKED HIM,\n\r\n\"WHAT WILL BE THE NAME OF OUR BABY?\" HE RAN OFF.\n\r\nLATER ON, ANOTHER BOY INVITED HER FOR A WALK, AFTER A FEW MINUTES HE\r\nSTARTED KISSING HER AND SHE ASKED HIM, \"WHAT WILL OUR BABY BE CALLED?\"\n\r\nHE CONTINUED, NOW SLOWLY TAKING HER CLOTHES OFF. \"WHAT WILL OUR BABY BE\r\nCALLED?\" SHE ASKED ONCE MORE. HE BEGAN TO HAVE S*X WITH HER.\r\n\"WHAT WILL OUR BABY BE CALLED?\" SHE ASKED AGAIN.\n\r\nAFTER HE WAS DONE, HE PEELED OFF HIS CONDOM, TIED IT IN A KNOT AND\r\nSAID.... \"IF HE GETS OUT OF THIS ONE.........He will be called\r\n................CHUCK NORRIS\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n<<<icon_biggrin.gif>>> <<<icon_biggrin.gif>>> <<<icon_biggrin.gif>>> <<<icon_biggrin.gif>>>", "date": "2006-07-26 12:12:00", "post_id": 1}, {"user_name": "Erica", "text": "þessir voru helvíti góðir <<<lol2.gif>>>", "date": "2006-07-26 12:23:00", "post_id": 2}, {"user_name": "24", "text": "aaaaaaaaaaaaahahhahahhahahahaah*and*ahahhahahahhah  ahhaha\n\r\nchuck norris er bestur!!!
