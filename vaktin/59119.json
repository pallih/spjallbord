Ég skrifaði þetta inn á reddit og set það líka hér með.\nAllar ábendingar vel þegnar! \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHi!\nThis is my problem, I have PS3 Fat edition and it started to freeze when playing games. It first started after maybe 30 mins of playing and then to 5 mins, but now it doesn't start any more. \nThis is what happens when I press the power button:\nI hear a peep, the Green light and blue light are on, no hard disk activity but I can hear it spinning. But no pictures on ether HDMI or AV. Sometimes I could get it to boot up but it freezes right after the menu pops up (Here is a video of the freezing. Not mine though but it is similar! \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvdgXbdx6Gk\n) \nWhat have I done:\n* Restart the video settings by holding down the power button when starting up.\n* I have plugged the hard drive into my pc and it came up. Works fine.\n* I have replaced the thermal paste on the chips.\n* After I did that, the PS3 finally went on and I could format the hard drive and update the firmware. Then I tried to start a game but again if freezes with screen [flickering and tearing](\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvdgXbdx6Gk\n). NO YELLOW light, only constant blue and green light.\nWhat I notice was that the power supplie was hot so I but it outside for few minutes and let it cool down, plugged it back in but no pictures and same LED lights. F!*%.\nAny ideas what I can do next?",
