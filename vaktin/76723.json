Has space to install 2.5\" HDD along side M2 SSD. SSD still healthy, 10% of TBW used, recently benched at 545/520.\nTaken very good care of this baby, it has traveled around the world with me a few times but have settled here and no longer need it. I recently cleaned out the interior and re-pasted the GPU and CPU. The 980M has aged well, runs new AAA titles at decent settings/frame rates. Easily runs Fortnite, DOTA, LoL.\nLooking for \n110k\n \n90k\nedit: Photos \nhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/vtLuzi8UgGc9rik68\n or \nhttps://imgur.com/a/H67zrLw",

The extended battery life comes from Nvidia Optimus which powers down the discrete GPU when it's not being used. However this does mean that it can't support a G-Sync monitor if you were to order a replacement from China.\nAdded to OP too. Obviously has a power brick too, can get pics of that if you want",
