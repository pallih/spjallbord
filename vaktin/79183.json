This meets or exceeds the requirements for 80 Plus Gold certification. \nOutstanding Noise/Ripple and DC Voltage Regulation \nThe AX1200 features individual DC-DC regulation for 3.3V, 5V and 12V rails, and secondary side synchronous rectification, utilizing MOSFETs that have lower losses than the conventional output rectification schemes. An advanced 4-layer modular connector board PCB ensures a better ground return plane, lower resistance and low voltage drops. This, combined with circuit trace optimization, also helps to minimize ripple and noise. \nFully Modular Cable System \nThe fully-modular, low-profile cable system provides maximum flexibility when building or upgrading your PC, and maximum airflow through your chassis. This allows you to utilize only the cables that you need, reducing cable clutter and maximizing the cooling performance of your PC. \nZero Voltage Switching / Zero Current Switching Technology \nThe Corsair AX1200 utilizes ZVS / ZCS technology to switch at near 0V and 0A, which ensures there are minimal switching losses, thereby maximizing efficiency and further reducing waste heat. \nUltra Low Noise Design \nThe AX1200 utilizes a low-noise, thermally-controlled 140mm fan, and employs sophisticated techniques to enhance cooling performance and reduce noise. This includes a specially designed PCB that channels airflow to reduce back-pressure and maximize the fan’s cooling ability. \nhttps://www.kitguru.net/components/powe ... -review/5/\n \nVerðhugmynd: 10.000\nSelst hæstbjóðanda \náhugasamir hafi samband!",
