It runs well but it needs to have the front CV joints and the thermostat replaced so I am lowering the price a lot.  The body is in good condition with only a few minor rust spots.  I am asking 180,000 ISK or best offer.  I also have 4 extra regular size tires I will give away with it.\nFeatures:\n-4 cylinder engine, petrol\n-Manual transmission 5 gears\n-4X4\n-Fuel injection, 1.590 cc, 97 hp\n-31” tires, 15” rims\n-Power steering\n-Electric windows\n-Electric side mirrors\n-Heated seats\n-Large tires\n-Tow ball",
