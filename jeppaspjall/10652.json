            "text": "I don't know exact English words at the time and some might laugh or bring better translation.\nStífufestingar could be explained as the axle-link fasteners. On Patrol this is probably referring to the front axle. Then this would describe how and where the axle is fastened to the chassis/frame.\nStýrisamrur is the where you connect to the steering box.  (think it's called pitman arm)\nThe lower part of the picture or similar part down on the axle.\nWhy dont you send the whole text and we might translate?",
